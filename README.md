This project includes 3 labs:
1. Firewall (Easy lab)
2. Attackmysql (Average lab)
3. Sbbuf (Difficult lab test)

To run these labs, practitioners need to:
- Download the imodule.tar file to your computer
- Put it in the folder containing the exercises: labtainer/trunk/labs
- Unzip and put all three exercises into the folder: labtainer/trunk/labs

Good luck <3
